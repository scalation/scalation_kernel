Scalation Kernel
================

Prerequisites
-------------
* Have the most recent version of Java (Java 8)
* Have Scala downloaded

Overview
--------

The **Scalation Kernel** project provides a lightweight
`Scala <http://www.scala-lang.org>`__ +
`ScalaTion <http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/scalation.html>`__ kernel for
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ notebooks. More
information is available on the `project
page <https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel>`__.

-  GitHub Project Page: https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/
-  PyPI Release Page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scalation-kernel/

Installation
------------

Installation requires a recent ScalaTion distribution (>= 1.3) from
`here <http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/scalation.html>`__. Once you have
ScalaTion, make sure the ``SCALATION_JARS`` environment variable is set
appropriately before continuing. This can be done individually, as seen
here:

It is important to note that this is the most important step, if the environment
variable is not correct, the program will not run properly.

Steps (Terminal):
* Find where you downloaded your copy of Scalation
* Use pwd to get the path
* Copy the path to use in the next steps.

::

    $ export SCALATION_JARS=/copiedPath/scalation_mathstat.jar
    $ export SCALATION_JARS=/copiedPath/scalation_modeling.jar:$SCALATION_JARS

It can also be done with a single command if you know the path to the
``scalation_models`` directory:

::

    $ export SCALATION_JARS=$(find copiedPath/scalation_models/lib | grep .jar | paste -sd ":" -)

To install **Scalation Kernel** from PyPI, you can use the following
commands:

::

    $ python3 -m pip install -U scalation_kernel
    $ python3 -m scalation_kernel.install

More installation options are presented in the `Installation
Guide <https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md>`__,
including deployment options for Python virtual environments and Docker
containers.

Using ScalaTion Kernel
----------------------

The dropdown menu in Jupyter labeled * New * should show an option to create a ScalaTion
notebook using the installed kernel.

A `User
Guide <https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/blob/master/docs/USER.md>`__
is currently under development. A complete draft is planned for the next
minor release. Until then, please see the collection of `example
notebooks <https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/tree/master/notebooks>`__
for usage examples.
