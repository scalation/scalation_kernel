    "To demonstrate K-means clustering, we're going to use Fisher’s and Anderson’s [`iris`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html) dataset from the R [`datasets`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) package. It is  a dataset that gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. For convenience, a copy of this dataset is provided at http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~mec/iris.csv. First, let's load in the data using a [`Relation`](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/scalation_1.3/scalation_mathstat/target/scala-2.12/api/scalation/relalgebra/Relation$.html) to see what's available:"
