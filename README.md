# Scalation Kernel

## Overview

The **Scalation Kernel** project provides a lightweight
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) + 
[ScalaTion](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/scalation.html) kernel for
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) notebooks. 
More information is available on the
[project page](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel).

 * GitHub Project Page: https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/
 * PyPI Release Page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scalation-kernel/

## Installation

### Prerequisites

 * Java 8 (>= 8) 
 * Scala 2.12 (>= 2.12)

Installation requires a recent ScalaTion distribution (>= 1.3) from
[here](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/scalation.html). Once you have
ScalaTion, make sure the `SCALATION_JARS` environment variable is
set appropriately before continuing. This can be done individually,
as seen here:

It is important to note that this is the most important step, if the environment
variable is not correct, the program will not run properly.

### Steps (Terminal):

 *  Find where you downloaded your copy of ScalaTion.
 *  Use `pwd` command to get the path location.
 *  Copy the path to use in the next steps.

Run the following commands with "/path/to/" replaced with the file path from the `pwd` command:
```
$ export SCALATION_JARS=/path/to/scalation_mathstat.jar
$ export SCALATION_JARS=/path/to/scalation_modeling.jar:$SCALATION_JARS
```
Example:
```
$ export SCALATION_JARS=/home/mepcotterell/Downloads/scalation_1.4/scalation_mathstat.jar
$ export SCALATION_JARS=/home/mepcotterell/Downloads/scalation_1.4/scalation_modeling.jar:$SCALATION_JARS
```

It can also be done with a single command if you know the path to the
`scalation_models` directory:

```
$ export SCALATION_JARS=$(find /path/to/scalation_models/lib | grep .jar | paste -sd ":" -)
```

To install **Scalation Kernel** from PyPI, you can use the following
commands:

```
$ python3 -m pip install -U scalation_kernel
$ python3 -m scalation_kernel.install
```

More installation options are presented in the
[Installation Guide](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md),
including deployment options for Python virtual environments and
Docker containers. 

## Using ScalaTion Kernel

The dropdown menu in Jupyter labeled **New** should show an option to create a ScalaTion
notebook using the installed kernel. 

A [User Guide](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/blob/master/docs/USER.md)
is currently under development. A complete draft is planned for the next minor
release. Until then, please see the collection of
[example notebooks](https://github.com/scalation/scalation_kernel/tree/master/notebooks)
for usage examples.
